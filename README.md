# NTU-SCSE-Survival-Guide
Hi there, I'm glad you found this repository.

I created this repository because one day I was organizing my hard drive and found a lot of code and assignments from my freshman year. I thought it would be a good idea to share it with juniors. I hope this repository will help you in your journey in NTU SCSE. Spread the word and share this repository with your friends.
